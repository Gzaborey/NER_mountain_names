The Kaokoveld region, covering north-western Namibia and south-western Angola, is one of the remotest areas in southern Africa. Although it’s extremely dry, it is a centre of species endemism: many species occur only there and nowhere else on earth.

New species continue to be found, especially in the Ovahimba mountain range, which runs parallel to the cold Atlantic ocean and is separated from it by the gravel plains and dunes of the northern Namib Desert.

The highest mountain peaks of this range are so inhospitable and difficult to access, because of the lack of roads and water, that few have ever scaled them. The exceptions are local herders of the semi-nomadic Himba, who drive their cattle and goats to richer pastures in the mountains during dry periods.

In 2021, I was part of a team of researchers from Namibia and Angola who aimed to investigate the biodiversity and endemism on some of the most remote peaks. We hypothesised that the mountain peaks harboured a large number of species, especially plants, insects and reptiles. That’s because there’s a rapid change in climate and topography (land features) from the hyper-arid, cool desert near the coast and the arid and seasonally warmer plains further inland to the cooler mountainous escarpment.

Through an EU-funded transfrontier conservation project, SCIONA, we had the opportunity to use the only safe option to get to the Ovahimba mountain peaks: a helicopter.

It is incredibly exciting to plan a trip to such a remote and beautiful wilderness area where few people have intervened in the ecosystem.

Because of the high cost and complicated logistics, we had to limit the visit to a few days on each of three mountain tops. Two were in Angola – Serra Cafema and Serra Tchamalindi in Iona National Park – and one was in the Otjihipa range of Namibia. The mountain tops were selected based on their altitude and remoteness. They also have many ecological niches based on exposure to wind and sun.

At each campsite, we left excitedly in different directions, to return and exchange findings and stories after sunset.

In the fascinating realm of geology, where the Earth's ancient history is written in stone and rock, the diverse landscapes that grace our planet are the result of a dynamic interplay of forces over millions of years. Let's embark on a geological journey, exploring the intricacies of tectonic plates, the sculpting power of erosion, and the majestic formations that define our world.

Consider the Himalayas, the colossal mountain range that crowns South Asia. This geological marvel is the consequence of the ongoing collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The relentless pressure generated by this collision has thrust the Earth's crust skyward, creating some of the world's tallest peaks, including the renowned Mount Everest, Lhotse, and Makalu. The Himalayas, with their towering summits and deep valleys, stand as a testament to the immense forces shaping the planet's crust.

Moving westward, the Rocky Mountains in North America tell a different geological tale. Formed by the uplifting of the North American Plate, this expansive mountain range extends from Canada to the United States, showcasing peaks like Denali in Alaska and Longs Peak in Colorado. Erosion, both by water and ice, has played a significant role in shaping the rugged landscapes we see today, leaving behind breathtaking canyons, alpine meadows, and towering cliffs.

Heading south, the Andes Mountains of South America offer a prime example of subduction, where the Nazca Plate plunges beneath the South American Plate. This dynamic interaction has given rise to the impressive stratovolcanoes like Cotopaxi and the towering peaks of the Andean range. The geothermal activity in this region is a reminder of the Earth's internal heat, manifesting in hot springs, geysers, and active volcanoes.

Venturing into Europe, the Alps provide a geologically rich landscape. The collision between the African and Eurasian plates has uplifted these iconic mountains, where peaks like Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn stand as geological sentinels. Glacial processes, from the movement of ancient ice sheets to the carving of deep valleys, have left their mark on the Alpine terrain.

In Africa, the East African Rift stands as a testament to the continent's geological dynamism. The rift, where the African Plate is splitting apart, offers a glimpse into the future formation of a new ocean. The Rwenzori Mountains, with their glaciers and unique ecosystems, are a consequence of this tectonic activity.

The geology of Oceania is prominently displayed in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. The collision between the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates has uplifted these mountains, creating stunning landscapes with peaks like Aoraki / Mount Cook and Tasman Glacier. The Southern Alps are a testament to the ongoing geological processes that continue to shape our world.

Geology, as a science, allows us to decipher the Earth's narrative, unraveling the tales written in its rocks and landforms. From the ancient Appalachian Mountains of North America to the volcanic peaks of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific, the Earth's geological diversity is a testament to the ceaseless dance of continents and the transformative power of time. As we marvel at the grandeur of mountains worldwide, let us also appreciate the geological forces that have sculpted these natural wonders and continue to shape the ever-evolving tapestry of our planet.
